# Kamran Shojaei, Ph.D.

Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in AI, scalable data pipelines, and scientific modeling. I specialize in building end-to-end systems that handle everything from data ingestion and preparation to model development, deployment, and monitoring.

- Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (focus: experimental signal analysis and data-driven modeling)  
- 4+ years at Intel delivering ML solutions in high-throughput manufacturing environments  
- Experience with deep learning (CNNs), embeddings, large language models (LLMs), and MLOps workflows  
- Skilled in Python, SQL, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, cnvrg.io)  
- Author of multiple publications at the intersection of AI and physical sciences  

## Featured Projects
- **rag-docs-copilot**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for document Q&A  
- **MachineLearning-Plasma**: Machine learning for probabilistic and deterministic predictive modeling from spectral data  
- **langpy**: Analysis of Langmuir probe measurements in Python  
- **duspy**: Zero-dimensional plasma modeling with nanoparticle interactions  

## Professional Highlights
In addition to the open-source projects shared here, I have designed and deployed large-scale ML systems in production, including real-time deep learning models for semiconductor process control and predictive pipelines operating on terabytes of spectral and metrology data. These systems powered more than 40 workflows across multiple engineering teams and drove measurable improvements in yield, reliability, and process stability.
